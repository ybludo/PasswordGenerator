<h1>The Secure Password Generator</h1>

<p>
  The Secure Password Generator is a project developed in Python aimed at creating robust passwords that meet minimum security requirements. This project generates passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and meet a user-specified minimum length. By using this generator, users can create highly secure passwords that are more difficult to be cracked by brute force attacks or conventional hacking methods.
